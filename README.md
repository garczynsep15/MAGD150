# MAGD150
A collection of my projects from MAGD150
These ones are my favorite

## Assignment 1
[Assignment One](https://github.com/garczynsep15/MAGD150/blob/GH-Pages/f17magd150lab01_garczynski/f17magd150lab01_garczynski.pde)
This assignment was the first one I ever did in processing. The theme was outerspace (one of my favorite things) so I made an alien. We were only allowed to use grey scale for the assignment, but I really like how it turned out.

## Assignment 4
[Assignment 4](https://github.com/garczynsep15/MAGD150/blob/GH-Pages/f17magd150lab04_garczynski/f17magd150lab04_garczynski.pde)
The amazing bouncy ball example. I personally think this project would have looked better if we knew how to use Vectors when it was assigned. I still really like it though. The theme was bouncy balls.

## Assignment 6
[Assignment 6](https://github.com/garczynsep15/MAGD150/blob/GH-Pages/s17_magd150_lab06_Garczynski/s17_magd150_lab06_Garczynski.pde)
This is my amazing screensaver. I chose to make the shapes change color at a slower speed because it reminded me of a loading screen for a space ship. I think this project generates some really cool color pallets and I would love to add a feature that lets the user take a screenshot so that I can use an eyedropper to take a sample of the colors. The theme was screensavers.

## Assignment 7
[Assignment 7](https://github.com/garczynsep15/MAGD150/blob/GH-Pages/s17_magd150_lab07_Garczynski/s17_magd150_lab07_Garczynski.pde)
This one probably took me the longest to do of all the assignments in this class. I spent so much time getting the leaves to not shoot off into infinity and only go so far. It was also a balancing game to figure out how many leaves I needed and what their boundary should be. We were supposed to also have a rotation and a scale in this project, but I couldn't figure out how to work them into my theme nicely, so I slyly wrote them in and proceeded to not use them. Somehow I still got 100% on this project though so thanks Professor Rhea. The theme was Nature.

## Assignment 8
[Assignment 8](https://github.com/garczynsep15/MAGD150/blob/GH-Pages/s17_magd150_lab8_Garczynski/s17_magd150_lab8_Garczynski.pde)
There isn't to much to this one except I love Sonic the Hedgehog. The theme was motivational(?) posters.
